 Sit back and let me tell you a story about information theory, kids...

# A STORY ABOUT INFORMATION THEORY

Here's the scenario: imagine you live in a ye-olde-dungeons-n-dragons magical fantasyland type of situation, and you own **a messaging service**. Now, thanks in no small part to the severe limitations on my creative imagination, this is a *fantasy-land* situation, so you do *not*, of course, run anything like an electronic messaging service, or even a rudimentary-but-fantastical postal service: you run the **Message-Bird Messaging Service**. 


## $\Rightarrow$ Aside 
* What, you may now ask yourself, is even the point in reading anymore of this garbage - so let me be completely up-front about this choice of a framing for an explanation of information theory. 

    ### IN SHORT:
    1. We are, in general, familiar with birds, and have a pretty good intuitive grasp on how - more or less, up to a very limited and ill-defined point - birds interact with the world at our scale.
    2. None of this is true for electromagnetic waves, or even sound-waves, beyond a bunch of fragile, hand-wavey analogies with stuff that happens in oceans and/or cups which have been, for some reason, attached together with string.
    3. The *general* principles of information theory are **medium-independent**, so it makes much more sense to frame it in terms of a world we kind-of-understand, rather than adding to the confusion with all these anologies to surfers with plastic-cup telephones or whatever. 
    
    ### *EMPHATIC BUT:* 
    * All sorts of interesting things happen when you apply information theory to *actual* systems in the world: that is to say, **the particular details** (of the system you're analysing in terms of information theory) **are important**.  But hold on - how can this be true if the *general principles* of information theory are, like I said, "medium independent"? Well, it's because...
        1. Information Theory is a **a mathematical theory**, unlike...
        2. Things in the 'real world', which are **not mathematical theories**: they are in fact all sorts of other kinds of things
    * It is hard to overstate how much trouble this distinction has caused over the years, so let's celebrate the fact that we can throw up our hands and pretty much **leave it for the philosophers to deal with** except for this one, extremely important point - let's even call it the **primo directive**:
    
        > In any application of information theory to real-world systems, ask yourself whether what you're doing **makes any fucking sense**

    * This is A LOT easier said than done, sadly: it's pretty safe to assume that the answer is no almost all of the time. But hey, that's how we roll out here in Real Science $^{^{TM}}$ so even more reason to develop our intuition about this stuff
